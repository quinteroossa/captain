## What is CAPTAIN?

CAPTAIN is a reinforcement learning system for optimizing conservation and restoration strategies in space and time.

### Key Features in v.3
⚙️ **Engineered for Scale:** Complete rewrite for high performance. Full GPU support and optimized sparse matrix operations allow for analysis at larger scales and finer resolutions.

🌱 **Dynamic Environment Scenarios:** Advanced support for time-evolving scenarios, incorporating climate change projections and dynamic implementation costs.  

🧩 **Modular & Customizable:** A flexible architecture allowing for highly tailored conservation policies and seamless integration of custom spatial data.

🎯 **Multi-objective Optimization:** Full support to quantify synergies and trade-offs between competing conservation and restoration targets.

🤖 **Decentralized regional agents:** Features regional agents designed to optimize spatially-distributed conservation strategies.


### ⚠️ Notice
**This repository contains a preview of CAPTAIN v.3.**

* **Status:** This is an active beta. The core simulation engine and training loops are functional, but the API and internal architecture are subject to change.
* **Development:** Primary development occurs in a private repository. This public mirror is provided for demonstration, testing, and early-access feedback.
* **Support:** Please report bugs via GitHub Issues, but note that feature requests may be prioritized based on our internal development roadmap.


## Installation


#### 1. Install `uv` 
`uv` is a high-performance Python package manager that ensures consistent environments across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* **macOS / Linux:**

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
* **Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

#### 2. Set up the Environment
Once `uv` is installed, clone the repository and sync the dependencies. This will automatically create a virtual environment (`.venv`) and install the correct version of PyTorch.

```bash
# Clone and enter the repository
git clone https://github.com/captain-project/captain3preview
cd captain3preview

# Sync dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync
```

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting - Windows-Specific Setup


If you are on Windows, you may need to perform two quick steps to ensure uv and Python work correctly:

Enable Long Paths: Windows has a default 260-character limit for file paths. High-performance libraries like PyTorch often exceed this.

Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:

```PowerShell
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem" -Name "LongPathsEnabled" -Value 1 -PropertyType DWORD -Force
```

Execution Policy: If PowerShell blocks the uv command, run:

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
